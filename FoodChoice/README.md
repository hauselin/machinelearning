# Food choice EEG study

## EEG dataset information

* stimulus-locked (time 0 = stimulus/food onset) raw data are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bums0s6fcrcgj43/AABbPLrmWDD7aYZz0rUmtHx6a?dl=0)
  * mne python should read the .set files (generated by MATLAB/eeglab)
  * Examples
    * 001_epochsAll.fdt
    * 001_epochsAll.set
* ~36 channels/sensors
* ignore channels M1 and M2 (reference channels)
* channels Corr and Zygo are electromyography (EMG; muscle) channels

## Design matrices (single-trial/epoch information) available

* Download design matrices [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/clr2hnyfupi0tmh/AADW76zjBjgs_d19BLV17GAoa?dl=0)

* Example design matrix info for subject 001
  * 001_epochsAll_designMat.mat (in general, use this version because it contains headers)
  * 001_epochsAll_designMat.txt (same as the .mat above but in .txt format [no headers though!])

### Column information in design matrices

* epochN: epoch/trial/repetition number
* artifactFlag: whether epoch contains noise (0: noise [exclude these epochs], 1: no noise [**include** these epochs])
* binIndicator: ignore this column
* food: food shown (40 different foods, hence 1 to 40)
* block: block type (1: natural, 2: health, 3: taste)
* familiar: familiarity with food rating (subject rating)
* health: healthiness of food rating (subject rating)
* like: liking of food rating (subject rating)
* taste: tastiness of food rating (subject rating)
* choice4: subject response (1, 2, 3, 4: strong no, no, yes, strong yes)
* choice2: subject response (0, 1 [strong no/no = 0, strong yes/yes = 1])
* rt: reaction/response time
* controlSuccess: self-control success (ignore this column for now)
